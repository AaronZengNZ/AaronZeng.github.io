    <h6 class='text-secondary m-5'>
        A lonely man called Max was wandering down the street and stumbled across a sale. It showed a free house! He was happy to get the house, so he rushed to the salesman and bought it. Everyone was staring at Max, with eyes so wide someone almost fainted. Max walked inside the small shack, which is now his house. One person was spying in his old broken windows and now he doesn't dare to open his eyes on that shack ever again. Max was worried about the story of the evil murderer. It was about a murderer getting chased by a gang of police. The police were just about to catch the murderer when he turned to the shack. He rushed into the shack and hid in a cupboard.
<br>
<br>
After 7 years a guy named Blake found a skeleton of him shoved up in a locked closet. The skeleton fell out of the cupboard. The cupboard shined and then Blake was dead seconds after. Max was worried. He stepped inside the house and then he heard something. It was a faint voice. Max crept towards the voice and then he heard a beep. Then he found out his car was broken! He ran outside to see if anyone was there, but all he saw or heard was the faint sound of a bird singing from a nearby tree. He ran inside the shack, took a bat, and walked around looking for them. He heard that strange voice again. This time he managed to make some words out of it.”Blake is dead. Get out or I’ll come and get you too!”Max ran to the doors and then a monster appeared.  He tried to run away but was quickly caught up. The monster grabbed Max and took out a sword. Then just as he was about to swing…
<br>
<br>
...He woke up. He was dreaming. Everything was fine, but what if the car’s still broken? What if it wasn't a dream? He jumped up on his feet and bolted to the garage. He looked at the car and the car was just like he left it. He walked outside and there were people walking down streets and there were cars, buses, and taxis everywhere. He walked outside and then he heard something. He shivered. He looked back and there was a guy there sitting on a bench. Max walked up to him.”Hi sir! Don’t know if you heard about me.I’m the guy who got that “Haunted” shack over there.”The man didn’t respond. Max walked up to him.
“Hello, sir?You there?HELLO?! Oh what the” Max tried to touch him but his hand went through. He was scared. Max slowly walked away while the man sat still. He walked up to someone else(Who was real)and said: “Do you see that guy?”The man responded with a “No. Why would you think that? If you do seem to see something weird it’s probably just a mirage.”Max walked into the shack and lied down. His head started to hurt. Then he became dizzy, then he fell asleep.
<br>
<br>
He woke up with a man walking in circles. He tried to get up but he was chained to the floor. The man walked to him and went through. Then he started laughing,” HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA you think you can get my HOME?!”Max was scared. He managed to break out of his chains and rushed to the door. The door was locked. The man/ghost walked up to him and took out something. It was too bright for Max to see. Then a gorilla came up to the ghost and the ghost blew up. Then the gorilla gave Max a toy gorilla. Then he ran off. Max woke up and found out that it was just a dream. He looked at the floor in front of the old shack door and saw the gorilla toy. He found a button on the back of it. He pressed it and the gorilla said.”See? This isn't a dream.”Then Max went outside and walked in the streets.
