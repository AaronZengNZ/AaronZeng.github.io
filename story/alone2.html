        Max looked around and heard faint screams. He ran toward the screams and then found people running from monsters like vampires or zombies. He ran towards the people running and then he reached a cliff. People and zombies were running over the huge hole but when Max tried to go there he fell down. Max then hit the floor and was unconscious. He woke up in a hospital. He walked away and then saw another cliff. He looked at the cliff and walked away. then a guy came. The man walked to him and went through. Then he started laughing,” HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA you think you can get my HOME?!”Max was worried. But then it sounded familiar. He ran to the hospital exit and it was locked. Then a gorilla came and the ghost blew up. The gorilla then said,” Why hello again.”He looked at his toy gorilla and it said,” Why hello again.”He started feeling dizzy then woke up from a long sleep. He was happy. He walked away. He looked at his gorilla toy and saw a secret lock. The gorilla said,” You need the key to the shack!”The key to the shack was lost long ago. A copy is left in a secret spot in the shack. Max ran into the house and looked everywhere. He could not find it. He tripped over a rug. He stood up and found a key under the rug. He took it and put it in the lock. He unlocked it and saw a stick. He took it and it turned into a staff. He touched the toy gorilla and it turned into a real gorilla. Then the gorilla said” That staff is a very ancient staff. It has the power to do lots of things. There is the flying power, the bridge power, the power to change objects and”-
“So it's a wizard staff? Wait, am I a wizard now? am I? Am I?”
“Not yet. You must learn to do it and it will take a long time so you...How did you learn the bridge spell?”Max walked inside the shack as brave as possible.He said 
“Where are you, stupid murderer guy!? I’m ready for you!”
<br>
<br>
He rushed to find the murderer. The murderer was nowhere in sight. He looked around but all he found was the skeleton of Blake. He walked around and tripped on a carpet. Under the carpet was the key! He picked it up and walked to the toy. He picked it up and put the key in. The gorilla turned blue and grew. Blue smoke started appearing all around Max. The gorilla toy soon faded from Max’s hand. Then the smoke started floating away. A strange object started taking shape. It was the gorilla! Max looked at the gorilla and asked,” Where are you from? What’s your name? How old are you? How come you were a toy? How did you get into my dreams?”He answered.
“I am from a planet far away called Aldo. My name is Oden. I am 127 years old. I was turned into a toy by an evil wizard. I used magic to get in your dreams. I need help to defeat the wizard’s minion and take down the wizard. The wizard is Ruben Shum. His minion is Monak maffy. Monak is a very powerful killer and he is the murderer that creeps around the shack. He stalks it every day and night. Just to defend a secret room, hidden in the shack.”Max was thinking.
“A secret room huh? Well, I should be able to find it easily.”Max and Oden walked to where the secret room should be. They walked past a shelf filled with old books. Oden took one of the books out and there was a big red button surrounded with ancient writing. It said:ᚠᛟᚱ ᛏᚺᛟᛋᛖ ᚹᚺᛟ ᛏᛟᚢᚲᚺ ᛏᚺᛁᛋ ᛒᚢᛏᛏᛟᚾ, ᚨ ᚲᚢᚱᛋᛖ ᚤᛟᚢ ᛗᚨᚤ ᚠᛁᚾᛞ, ᛁᛏ ᚲᛟᚢᛚᛞ ᛗᚨᚴᛖ ᚤᛟᚢ ᚲᚱᚨᛉᚤ, ᛒᛟᛚᛞ, ᛟᚱ ᛒᛚᛁᚾᛞ! Oden spoke.
“For those who touch this button, a curse you may find, it could make you crazy, bold, or blind!”Max pressed the button.
